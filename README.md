Kalman-Filters-Analysis
=======================

Crowd data analysis using Kalman Filters

Install JSONLab
===============

The installation of JSONlab is no different than any other simple MATLAB toolbox. You only need to download/unzip the JSONlab package to a folder, and add
the folder's path to MATLAB/Octave's path list by using the following command:

`addpath('/path/to/jsonlab');`

If you want to add this path permanently, you need to type "pathtool", browse to the jsonlab root folder and add to the list, then click "Save". Then, run 
"rehash" in MATLAB, and type "which loadjson", if you see an output, that means JSONlab is installed for MATLAB/Octave.

Running the server
=================

1.Install Nodejs.  
2.run `npm install -g node-static`  
3.Goto the public folder of the directory via terminal and type `static`  
4.Now open `127.0.0.1:8080` on a web browser.
